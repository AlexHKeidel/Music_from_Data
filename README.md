# Music_from_Data
This project uses a publically available anonymised data set. You can replace the data with any other csv file for different results.

The three examples use three different concepts to generate "Music" from the input data file:
* Random vs Perlin noise
* Conway's Game of Life [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
* Genetic / Evolutionary Algorithm
* 
## Installation
Install [Processing](processing.org)

## Running the Program
Just execute the scripts in your Processing IDE. In some cases you can change some variables at the top of the code for different results.

You can change the input data by providing your own CSV file and changing the variable for the data loader class.
